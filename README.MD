# This is Findsy
Findsy is a web app that allows people to easily organize and find events in the community. 

## Goal
The goal of the project is to allow neighbors to post events that others can see. That way if someone wants to, for example, host a ocean clean up event, they would have a app where others can see that and sign up. It is an app to mainly connect the community and also help save the environment.

## Built with
